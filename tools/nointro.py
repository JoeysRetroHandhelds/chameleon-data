"""Turn a game title into its ROM checksums, per console.

The library matches games by CRC32: the same checksum No-Intro lists and a zip stores for
the file inside. So anything that wants to name a game the app can find - a curated set, a
club pick - has to speak in CRCs, and the bridge from a plain title to a CRC is a No-Intro
dat, which is exactly a name-to-CRC table.

libretro-database carries those dats, the same source `arcade-names.py` reads its arcade
mapping from. Each platform pack names its libretro system in `scraperSourceList` as a
`LIBRETRO:...` entry, and that string is the dat's filename, so a pack resolves to a dat
with no table of our own to keep.

One game has several dumps - USA, Europe, Japan, revisions - each a different CRC. A title
therefore resolves to a *set* of CRCs, so a set or a pick lights up for whichever copy the
person owns rather than only the one region we happened to name.

This is a library, not a script: `resolver(shortname)` gives back something that maps a
title to its CRCs. Fetched dats are cached under `tools/.cache` so a run that touches forty
platforms does not re-download on every invocation.
